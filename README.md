# py-fastcast-excel-to-m3u
A conversion tool from Fastcast Excel format to M3U files.

## About this tool
This tool was created as a thank you to the fine folks at Fastcast, who have always treated me so well as a customer.  This tool takes the Fastcast Excel playlist export, and converts it into a M3U file for import.  This is useful in the following scenarios:
- Migrating from one server to another
- Archiving of playlists for backup or later import.

This is meant to be a single file solution, so it is nice and portable.

## Good to knows
- Requires openpyxl for reading Excel files (pip install openpyxl)
- If you are migrating between servers, your file structure needs to be the same
- If you delete the media files in the M3U, they will not import properly.

## How to Use
To be filled in later.

## Release Notes:
None at this time.
